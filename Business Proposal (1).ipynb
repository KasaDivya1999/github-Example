For having better facilities around the neighborhood  to access the Cafe, School, Super market, medical shops, grocery shops, mall, theatre, hospital etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Project aim to create an analysis of features for a people migrating to Scarborough in search for the best neighborhood as a comparative analysis between neighborhoods. The features include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for emergency, water resources and recreational facilities. It will help people to get awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place for their work or to start a new fresh life.\n",

    "## Problem :\n",
    "\n",
    "The major purpose of this project, is to suggest a better neighborhood in a new city for the person who are shiffting there. Connectivity to the airport, bus stand, city center, markets and other daily needs things nearby.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sorted list of house in terms of housing prices in a ascending or descending order\n",
    "2. Sorted list of schools in terms of location, fees, rating and reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Location:\n",
    "Scarborough is a popular destination for new immigrants in Canada to reside. As a result, it is one of the most diverse and multicultural areas in the Greater Toronto Area, being home to various religious groups and places of worship. Although immigration has become a hot topic over the past few years with more governments seeking more restrictions on immigrants.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Foursquare API:\n",
    "This project would use Four-square API as its prime data gathering source as it has a database of millions of places, especially their places API which provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Work Flow:\n",
    "Due to http request limitations the number of places per neighborhood parameter would reasonably be set to 100 and the radius parameter would be set to 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clustering Approach:\n",
    "To compare the similarities of two cities, we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like New York and Toronto. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm\n",

    "## Libraries :\n",
    "Pandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Folium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit Learn: For importing k-means clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON: Library to handle JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "XML: To separate data from presentation and XML stores data in plain text format.\n",
